Data includes soil surface temperature boundary conditions and soil temperatures at depth for different land cover types (measured half-hourly). Aggregated advection temperatures for a bog and a fen are included to modify incoming flow temperatures (daily measurements for each day of the year). The relationship between snow cover and soil temperature is considered at this field site (annual data aggregate). This data was used as forcing for the included permafrost thaw model, and results can be compared to both soil temperatures and the measurements of active layer and permafrost depths (measured in the spring and fall of each year). This data was collected and used in a modelling study to determine the controls on talik formation.
