Both sites were resampled in 2001. In 2002 ten transects at the exposed site only were resampled (tag numbers unknown), and data is presented here for algal cover (%), invertebrate cover (%), and invertebrate density including sea stars.\r\n<p/>\r\nWizard Islet (48°51\u201929.5\u201dN, 125°09\u201931\u201dW) is located within the Deer Group Islands in Barkley Sound and has an area of 1.73 hectares at low tide. The sheltered site (with less wave exposure) is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the northeast side and is characterized by Fucus and Phyllospadix (seagrass). The exposed site is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the southwest side and is characterized by Egregia (feather-boa kelp), goose-necked barnacles and Alaria (brown alga).
