Both sites were resampled in 2001, 2007 and 2009, and the exposed site was resampled in 2002 and 2003. In 2017, the exposed site was sampled again. Data is presented here for macroalgae and colonial fauna cover (%), and invertebrate presence/absence for species richness.\r\n<p/>\r\nWizard Islet (48°51\u201929.5\u201dN, 125°09\u201931\u201dW) is located within the Deer Group Islands in Barkley Sound and has an area of 1.73 hectares at low tide. The sheltered site (with less wave exposure) is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the northeast side and is characterized by Fucus and Phyllospadix (seagrass). The exposed site is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the southwest side and is characterized by Egregia (feather-boa kelp), goose-necked barnacles and Alaria (brown alga).\r\n<p/>\r\nFifteen vertical transects were randomly selected at the exposed site. Tag numbers were 3, 4, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 30, 40, 44, 45, 50.\r\n<p/>\r\nSampling was done at tidal heights of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5m. Quadrats of 25x25cm were used to estimate percent cover of macroalgae and colonial fauna, and invertebrate presence/absence for species richness.\r\n<p/>\r\nData was collected by students in the Coastal Biodiversity and Conservation course taught by Dr. Barb Beasley and Dr. Caroline Fox with Teaching Assistant Sarah Friesen July 24 - September 1, 2017.
