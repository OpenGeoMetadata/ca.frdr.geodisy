To do this we selected ten sites on south facing slopes with both alder shrub patches and adjacent shrub-free tundra and established quadrats in each habitat and across topographic positions. Within each of these quadrats we selected two sub-quadrats for vegetation community composition and birch height observations. We also measured a suite of environmental variables within 50 cm of each larger quadrat.
