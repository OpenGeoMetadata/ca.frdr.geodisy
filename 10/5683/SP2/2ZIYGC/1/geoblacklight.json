Bird species were identified by auditory and visual surveys June 3 to June 6, 2011.\r\n<p/>\r\nBoth plots are located on the north side of Grappler Inlet near Bamfield, British Columbia on property owned and administered by the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. The centre of the SI/MAB plot has GPS coordinates 48°50\u201919.00\u201dN, 125°08\u201902.00\u201dW (48.83861111, -125.13388889), and the centre of the EMAN plot has GPS coordinates 48°50\u201905.00\u201dN, 125°07\u201945.00\u201dW (48.83472222, -125.12916667).\r\n<p/>\r\nBoth plots are divided into 25 quadrats (20m x 20m). SI/MAB quadrats 1 and 2 were eliminated from the study due to the unsafe slope of the cliff. Live and dead standing trees with a DBH (diameter at breast height) ≥ 8 cm were censused for species, DBH, status (physical condition) and tree health.\r\n<p/>\r\nAuditory and visual surveys were done in both plots to determine bird presence and call frequencies of nesting and breeding species.\r\n<p/>\r\nData was collected by students in the Coastal Biodiversity and Conservation course taught by Dr. Barb Beasley and Dr. Wendy Palen May 2-June 10, 2011 with Teaching Assistant Dane Stabel.
