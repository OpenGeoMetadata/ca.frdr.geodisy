This dataset contains SOG model output data from 2001 to 2012 across 18 freshwater dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) scenarios. The 18 scenarios span a grid of 6 freshwater TA cases and 3 freshwater DIC:TA cases. The values for these freshwater scenarios were chosen based on a detail analysis of the Fraser River.
