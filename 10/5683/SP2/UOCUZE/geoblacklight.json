We addressed the following questions: 1) Can application of the Right Product at planting reduce environmental losses compared to the regular fertilizer application? 2) Can application of nitrogen at the Right Time reduce environmental losses compared to the fertilizer application at planting? 3) Can application of a combination of Right Product and Right Time provide additional reduction of environmental nitrogen losses? The Right Product consisted of either an urea-based enhanced efficiency fertilizer (EEF, urea with nitrification and urease inhibitor) or an urea-ammonium-nitrate (UAN)-based EEF (UAN with nitrification and urease inhibitor). The Right Time consisted in delaying application until the 6-8th leaf stage (application as side-dress). Environmental nitrogen losses considered were emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and leaching losses in the form of nitrate.
