Both sites were resampled in 2001, and the exposed site was resampled in 2002. In 2003 fifteen transects at the exposed site only were sampled again. Tag numbers were 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 20, 25, 26, 27, 34, 44, 45. Data presented here for algal cover (%), invertebrate cover (%), invertebrate density and seastar density was obtained from a 2009 Microsoft Access database.\r\n<p/>\r\nWizard Islet (48°51\u201929.5\u201dN, 125°09\u201931\u201dW) is located within the Deer Group Islands in Barkley Sound and has an area of 1.73 hectares at low tide. The sheltered site (with less wave exposure) is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the northeast side and is characterized by Fucus and Phyllospadix (seagrass). The exposed site is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the southwest side and is characterized by Egregia (feather-boa kelp), goose-necked barnacles and Alaria (brown alga).
