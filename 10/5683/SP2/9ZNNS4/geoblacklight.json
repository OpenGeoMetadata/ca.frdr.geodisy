The data were generated by having our participants complete surveys that experimentally varied fine conditions in two settings: a daycare vignette asking parents about late pick up of children and a tax reporting scenario asking participants about fully reporting income. The data were generated as part of a project seeking to replicate the result in Uri Gneezy & Aldo Rustichini, \"A Fine is a Price\" (2000), XXIX Journal of Legal Studies 1. This well known study produced the surprising result that imposing a fine could increase non-compliance by individuals. Our data and analysis were generated to test the robustness of this finding using an alternative methodology and multiple settings. Details of analysis and results can be found in our article, Cherie Metcalf, Emily A. Satterthwaite, J. Shahar Dillbary, Brock Stoddard, \u201cIs a Fine Still a Price?
