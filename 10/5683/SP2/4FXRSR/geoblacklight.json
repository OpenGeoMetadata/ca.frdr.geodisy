Study 1 analyzed the word content of women tweeting about sexism; the use of female words correlated with the use of well-being words. Studies 2 and 3 were a questionnaire and experimental study, respectively. In both studies, perceiving sexism as pervasive predicted greater gender identity, which predicted greater well-being. These relationships held for those believing online activism is active vs. passive (Study 2) and for those induced to participate in online activism vs a control group (Study 3).
