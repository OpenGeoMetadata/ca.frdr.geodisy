This data was collected as part of a study on the impacts of boat noise on a wild fish, Porichthys notatus, and its predators.\r\n\r\nThis video was produced using underwater cameras: 1) A custom-built Teamed Optic-Acoustic Device (TOAD) for predator-prey component, which consisted of a custom-built underwater camera and a synced hydrophone (HTI- 96-min, High Tech Inc., Long Beach, MS); 2) A Microcam (MVC2120WP-LED, Micro Video Products, www.microvideo.org) for individual midshipman behaviour component. See Sarika Cullis-Suzuki's PhD thesis (http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/10526/) for further details on equipment.
