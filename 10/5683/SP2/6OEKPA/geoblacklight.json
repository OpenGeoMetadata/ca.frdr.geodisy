It combines total non-response (households) and partial non-response (questions). A lower GNR indicates a lower risk of non-response bias and, as a result, a lower risk of inaccuracy. The counts and estimates for geographic areas with a GNR equal to or greater than 50% are not published in the standard products. The counts and estimates for these areas have a high risk of non-response bias, and in most cases, should not be released. All the geographies requested for this tabulation have been cleared for the release of income data and have a GNR under 50%.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHousing Tenure Including Presence of Mortgage (5)<br>\r\n1.\tTotal \u2013 Private non-band non-farm off-reserve households with an income greater than zero by housing tenure<br>\r\n2.\t  Households who own<br>\r\n3.\t    With a mortgage1<br>\r\n4.\t    Without a mortgage<br>\r\n5.\t  Households who rent<br>\r\nNote: 1) Presence of mortgage - Refers to whether the owner households reported mortgage or loan payments for their dwelling. <br><br>\r\n\r\n2015 Before-tax Household Income Quartile Ranges (5)<br>\r\n1.\tTotal \u2013 Private households by quartile ranges1, 2, 3<br>\r\n2.\t  Count of households under or at quartile 1<br>\r\n3.\t  Count of households between quartile 1 and quartile 2 (median) (including at quartile 2)<br>\r\n4.\t  Count of households between quartile 2 (median) and quartile 3 (including at quartile 3)<br>\r\n5.\t  Count of households over quartile 3<br>\r\nNotes: 1) A private household will be assigned to a quartile range depending on its CSD-level location and depending on its tenure (owned and rented). Quartile ranges for owned households in a specific CSD are delimited by the 2015 before-tax income quartiles of owned households with an income greater than zero and residing in non-farm off-reserve dwellings in that CSD. Quartile ranges for rented households in a specific CSD are delimited by the 2015 before-tax income quartiles of rented households with an income greater than zero and residing in non-farm off-reserve dwellings in that CSD.<br>\r\n2) For the income quartiles dollar values (the delimiters) please refer to Table 1.<br>\r\n3) Quartiles 1 to 3 are suppressed if the number of actual records used in the calculation (not rounded or weighted) is less than 16. For cases in which the renters\u2019 quartiles or the owners\u2019 quartiles (figures from Table 1) of a CSD are suppressed the CSD is assigned to a quartile range depending on the provincial renters\u2019 or owners\u2019 quartile figures.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNumber of Bedrooms (Unit Size) (6)<br>\r\n1.\tTotal \u2013 Private households by number of bedrooms1<br>\r\n2.\t  0 bedrooms (Bachelor/Studio)<br>\r\n3.\t  1 bedroom<br>\r\n4.\t  2 bedrooms<br>\r\n5.\t  3 bedrooms<br>\r\n6.\t  4 bedrooms<br>\r\nNote: 1) Dwellings with 5 bedrooms or more included in the total count only.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHousing Suitability (6)<br>\r\n1.\tTotal - Housing suitability<br>\r\n2.\t  Suitable<br>\r\n3.\t  Not suitable<br>\r\n4.\t    One bedroom shortfall<br>\r\n5.\t    Two bedroom shortfall<br>\r\n6.\t    Three or more bedroom shortfall<br>\r\nNote: 1) 'Housing suitability' refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is, whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms, as calculated using the NOS.<br>\r\n'Housing suitability' assesses the required number of bedrooms for a household based on the age, sex, and relationships among household members. An alternative variable, 'persons per room,' considers all rooms in a private dwelling and the number of household members.<br>\r\nHousing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies.<br><br>\r\n\r\nShelter-cost-to-income-ratio (4) <br>\r\n1.\tTotal \u2013 Private non-band non-farm off-reserve households with an income greater than zero<br>\r\n2.\t  Spending less than 30% of households total income on shelter costs<br>\r\n3.\t  Spending 30% or more of households total income on shelter costs<br>\r\n4.\t    Spending 50% or more of households total income on shelter costs<br>\r\nNote: 'Shelter-cost-to-income ratio' refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHousehold Statistics (8)<br>\r\n1.\tTotal \u2013 Private non-band non-farm off-reserve households with an income greater than zero1<br>\r\n2.\t  Average household income in 2015 ($)2<br>\r\n3.\t  Median household income in 2015 ($)3<br>\r\n4.\t  Quartile 1 of household income in 2015 ($)4<br>\r\n5.\t  Quartile 2 (median) of household income in 2015 ($)4<br>\r\n6.\t  Quartile 3 of household income in 2015 ($)4<br>\r\n7.\t  Average monthly shelter costs ($)2,5<br>\r\n8.\t  Median monthly shelter costs ($)3,5<br>\r\nNotes: 1) All households statistics are calculated based on the distribution of private households in non-farm off-reserve non-band occupied private dwellings with a before-tax household income greater than zero.<br>\r\n2) The average is suppressed if the number of actual records used in the calculation (not rounded or weighted) is less than 4. <br>\r\n3) The median is suppressed if the number of actual records used in the calculation (not rounded or weighted) is less than 8. <br>\r\n4) Quartiles 1 to 3 are suppressed if the number of actual records used in the calculation (not rounded or weighted) is less than 16.<br>\r\n5) Shelter costs for owner households include, where applicable, mortgage payments, property taxes and condominium fees, along with the costs of electricity, heat, water and other municipal services.
