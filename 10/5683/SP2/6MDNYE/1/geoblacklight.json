The sites were resampled in 2001, and data is presented here for algal and invertebrate cover (%) and invertebrate density.\r\n<p/>\r\nWizard Islet (48°51\u201929.5\u201dN, 125°09\u201931\u201dW) is located within the Deer Group Islands in Barkley Sound and has an area of 1.73 hectares at low tide. The sheltered site (with less wave exposure) is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the northeast side and is characterized by Fucus and Phyllospadix (seagrass). The exposed site is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the southwest side and is characterized by Egregia (feather-boa kelp), goose-necked barnacles and Alaria (brown alga).\r\n<p/>\r\nFifteen vertical transects at each site were sampled by randomly selecting 15 of the 50 numbered tags (actual tag numbers unknown). Sampling was done at tidal heights of 0.2 (exposed site only), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5m. Quadrats of 25x25cm were used to determine species percent cover and abundance for floral and faunal macroorganisms. Quadrats of 50x50cm were used for larger organisms such as Astroidea and Pisaster. To maintain consistency, all quadrats were positioned to the left and above each point on the transect (when facing away from the water).\r\n<p/>\r\nSpreadsheets contain columns labelled EH1Q1 to EH8Q15 and SH2Q1 to SH8Q15. It is assumed that E and S refer to Exposed and Sheltered, H1-8 refers to tidal height and Q1-15 refers to transect. Sheltered columns start at SH2 because 0.2m was not sampled.\r\n<p/>\r\nData was collected by students in the Coastal Biodiversity and Conservation course taught by Dr. Tom Berman with Teaching Assistant Dana Haggarty and support from Russ Markel July 23-Aug 31, 2001.
