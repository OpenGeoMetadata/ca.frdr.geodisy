New multi-system geochronological data from the immediate footwall of the Dangardzong fault, the main graben-forming structure in the Thakkhola, outline decelerating cooling paths. The average cooling rate in the footwall of the Dangardzong fault changes from 55 ± 5 ˚C/Ma in the early Miocene (~ 22-13) defined by monazite U-Th/Pb pluton crystallization ages, mica <sup>40<\/sup>Ar/<sup>39<\/sup>Ar cooling ages and zircon U-Th/He ages, to 18 ± 7 ˚C/Ma in the middle to late Miocene (~13-8 Ma) between zircon and apatite U-Th/He ages,  and finally to 6 ± 3 ˚C/Ma from the late Miocene to present day (cooling post apatite U-Th/He closure). The changing cooling rate is interpreted to reflect the widespread development of graben in the Tibetan plateau beginning in the middle Miocene and the progressive partitioning of strain away from the Thakkhola.
