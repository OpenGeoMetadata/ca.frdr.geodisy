The chained Fisher indices were computed using highway construction bid data from 47 U.S. states. The quarterly indices currently span 2005 to 2017. The highway construction cost indices encompass all highway construction costs for each pavement type, while the maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) cost indices include only the effect of bid items related to pavement repair. These indices are maintained on an annual basis, with future updates scheduled to take place in the summer of 2020.
