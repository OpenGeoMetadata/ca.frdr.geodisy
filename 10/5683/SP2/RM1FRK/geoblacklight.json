Three pairs - transparent and opaque - of ACE Stations were used to measure CO2 exchange at Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO) across three different soil conditions. This allowed for possible factors controlling CO2 exchange of wet sedge sites to be interpreted. These stations were run from June 15, 2014 till July 30, 2014. The ACE stations were set to sample for three-minutes (18 ten-second intervals) every 30-minutes. Furthermore, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and net CO2 exchange rate (NCER) were also collected. Collection of this data has allowed for exploration of the different temporal variabilities in CO2 exchange at these wet sedge areas at a range of scales. Use of this data helped support the conclusion of CO2 storage in wet sedge meadows.
