Forecasting the price of the market directly affected energy producer and water user.There are two software, Tableau and Python, which are utilized to model and visualize both markets for the aim of estimating possible price in the future.The role of those software is to provide an optimal alternative with different methods (deterministic versus stochastic).\r\nThe base of predicted price in Tableau is deterministic\u2014global optimization and time series.\r\nIn contrast, Monte Carlo simulation as a stochastic method is modeled by Python software. \r\n<p>The purpose of the project is, first, to predict the price of crude oil and bottled water with stochastic (Monte Carlo simulation) and deterministic (Tableau software),second, to compare the prices in a case study of Crude Oil Prices: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and the U.S. bottled water.\r\n\r\n<p>1.\tIntroduction  \r\nPredicting stock and stock price index is challenging due to uncertainties involved. We can analyze with a different aspect; the investors perform before investing in a stock or the evaluation of stocks by means of studying statistics generated by market activity such as past prices and volumes. The data analysis attempt to identify stock patterns and trends that may predict the estimation price in the future. Initially, the classical regression (deterministic) methods were used to predict stock trends; furthermore, the uncertainty (stochastic) methods were used to forecast as same as deterministic. According to Deterministic versus stochastic volatility: implications for option pricing models (1997), Paul Brockman & Mustafa Chowdhury researched that the stock return volatility is deterministic or stochastic. They reported that \u201cResults reported herein add support to the growing literature on preference-based stochastic volatility models and generally reject the notion of deterministic volatility\u201d (Pag.499). For this argument, we need to research for modeling forecasting historical data with two software (Tableau and Python). \r\n\r\n<p>In order to forecast analyze Tableau feature, the software automatically chooses the best of up to eight models which generates the highest quality forecast. According to the manual of Tableau , Tableau assesses forecast quality optimize the smoothing of each model. The optimization model is global. The main part of the model is a taxonomy of exponential smoothing that analyzes the best eight models with enough data. The real- world data generating process is a part of the forecast feature and to support deterministic method. Therefore, Tableau forecast feature is illustrated the best possible price in the future by deterministic (time \u2013 series and prices).\r\nMonte Carlo simulation (MCs) is modeled by Python, which is predicted the floating stock market index . Forecasting the stock market by Monte Carlo demonstrates in mathematics to solve various problems by generating suitable random numbers and observing that fraction of the numbers that obeys some property or properties. The method utilizes to obtain numerical solutions to problems too complicated to solve analytically. It randomly generates thousands of series representing potential outcomes for possible returns. Therefore, the variable price is the base of a random number between possible spot price between 2002-2016 that present a stochastic method.
