Data is presented here. For a comparison of canopy cover in the SI/MAB plot between 2001 and 2007, see the 2007 student report.\r\n<p/>\r\nBoth plots are located on the north side of Grappler Inlet near Bamfield, British Columbia on property owned and administered by the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. The centre of the SI/MAB plot has GPS coordinates 48°50\u201919.00\u201dN, 125°08\u201902.00\u201dW (48.83861111, -125.13388889), and the centre of the EMAN plot has GPS coordinates 48°50\u201905.00\u201dN, 125°07\u201945.00\u201dW (48.83472222, -125.12916667).\r\n<p/>\r\nBoth plots are divided into 25 quadrats (20m x 20m). Live and dead standing trees were censused for species, DBH (diameter at breast height) and status (physical condition). Only trees with a DBH ≥ 8 cm were censused in the EMAN plot to avoid the detrimental effects of nailing tags into the trunks of small trees. This same principle was applied to new trees in the SI/MAB plot but none were found.\r\n<p/>\r\nData was collected by students in the Coastal Biodiversity and Conservation course taught by Dr. Tom Herman and Dr. Barb Beasley July 23-Aug 31, 2007 with Teaching Assistant Ben Starkhouse.
