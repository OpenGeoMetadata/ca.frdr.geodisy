Measurements were taken from 18 lysimeters containing Elora loam (9) and Cambridge sand (9) soil columns. For each lysimeter, data is available for the weight of the soil column and drainage tank, as well as the soil matric potential, electrical conductivity, temperature, and volumetric water content at depths of 5, 10, 30, 60 and 90 cm. This dataset includes data collected from January 1, 2019 to June 3, 2019. Data for June 4, 2019 to December 31, 2019 will be added as it becomes available.
