Data sets were collected from air monitoring stations in Kuwait to allow development, testing, and validation of stochastic and machine learning techniques.<\/p>\r\n<p>Drone traffic study: A method to determine vehicle fleet composition and vehicle density on a road was developed that employed an unmanned aerial system to capture images of cars stacked at a signalized intersection. The images were processed using photogrammetry software to create a digital elevation model that allowed measurement of distances and fleet composition.<\/p>\r\n<p>Air quality study: Predicting future air pollution concentrations was accomplished using a deep learning technique consisting of a recurrent neural network with long short term memory. Datasets from a single air monitoring station were used to train and test the model. The resulting model was able to predict 8 hr averaged ozone out to 72 hours with a Mean Absolute Error of less than 2 ppb, outperforming traditional methods.<\/p> ","dct_issued_dt":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/XXTAU9\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"http://geoserver.frdr.ca/geodisy/10/5683/SP2/XXTAU9/iso19115.zip\"}","dc_creator_sm":["Freeman, Brian"],"geoblacklight_version":"1.0","layer_id_s":"g_10_5683_sp2_xxtau9m1"}
