It combines total non-response (households) and partial non-response (questions). A lower GNR indicates a lower risk of non-response bias and, as a result, a lower risk of inaccuracy. The counts and estimates for geographic areas with a GNR equal to or greater than 50% are not published in the standard products. The counts and estimates for these areas have a high risk of non-response bias, and in most cases, should not be released. \r\n<br><br>\r\nHousing Tenure Including Presence of Mortgage (5)<br>\r\n1.\tTotal \u2013 Private non-band non-farm off-reserve households with an income greater than zero by housing tenure<br>\r\n2.\t  Households who own<br>\r\n3.\t    With a mortgage1<br>\r\n4.\t    Without a mortgage<br>\r\n5.\t  Households who rent<br>\r\nNotes: 1) Presence of mortgage - Refers to whether the owner households reported mortgage or loan payments for their dwelling. <br><br>\r\n\r\n2015 Before-tax Household Income Quartile Ranges (5)<br>\r\n1.\tTotal \u2013 Private households by quartile ranges1, 2, 3<br>\r\n2.\t  Count of households under or at quartile 1<br>\r\n3.\t  Count of households between quartile 1 and quartile 2 (median) (including at quartile 2)<br>\r\n4.\t  Count of households between quartile 2 (median) and quartile 3 (including at quartile 3)<br>\r\n5.\t  Count of households over quartile 3<br>\r\nNotes: 1) A private household will be assigned to a quartile range depending on its CSD-level location and depending on its tenure (owned and rented). Quartile ranges for owned households in a specific CSD are delimited by the 2015 before-tax income quartiles of owned households with an income greater than zero and residing in non-farm off-reserve dwellings in that CSD. Quartile ranges for rented households in a specific CSD are delimited by the 2015 before-tax income quartiles of rented households with an income greater than zero and residing in non-farm off-reserve dwellings in that CSD.<br>\r\n2) For the income quartiles dollar values (the delimiters) please refer to Table 1.<br>\r\n3) Quartiles 1 to 3 are suppressed if the number of actual records used in the calculation (not rounded or weighted) is less than 16.

A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms, as calculated using the NOS.<br>\r\n'Housing suitability' assesses the required number of bedrooms for a household based on the age, sex, and relationships among household members. An alternative variable, 'persons per room,' considers all rooms in a private dwelling and the number of household members.<br>\r\nHousing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies.<br><br>\r\n\r\nShelter-cost-to-income-ratio (4) <br>\r\n1.\tTotal \u2013 Private non-band non-farm off-reserve households with an income greater than zero<br>\r\n2.\t  Spending less than 30% of households total income on shelter costs<br>\r\n3.\t  Spending 30% or more of households total income on shelter costs<br>\r\n4.\t    Spending 50% or more of households total income on shelter costs<br>\r\nNote: 'Shelter-cost-to-income ratio' refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs.<br>\r\n\r\nHousehold Statistics (8)<br><br>\r\n1.\tTotal \u2013 Private non-band non-farm off-reserve households with an income greater than zero1<br>\r\n2.\t  Average household income in 2015 ($)2<br>\r\n3.\t  Median household income in 2015 ($)3<br>\r\n4.\t  Quartile 1 of household income in 2015 ($)4<br>\r\n5.\t  Quartile 2 (median) of household income in 2015 ($)4<br>\r\n6.\t  Quartile 3 of household income in 2015 ($)4<br>\r\n7.\t  Average monthly shelter costs ($)2,5<br>\r\n8.\t  Median monthly shelter costs ($)3,5<br>\r\nNotes: 1) All households statistics are calculated based on the distribution of private households in non-farm off-reserve non-band occupied private dwellings with a before-tax household income greater than zero.<br>\r\n2) The average is suppressed if the number of actual records used in the calculation (not rounded or weighted) is less than 4. <br>\r\n3) The median is suppressed if the number of actual records used in the calculation (not rounded or weighted) is less than 8. <br>\r\n4) Quartiles 1 to 3 are suppressed if the number of actual records used in the calculation (not rounded or weighted) is less than 16.<br>\r\n5) Shelter costs for owner households include, where applicable, mortgage payments, property taxes and condominium fees, along with the costs of electricity, heat, water and other municipal services.
