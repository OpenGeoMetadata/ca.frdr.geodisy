An online survey tool as well as RDD computer-assisted telephone interviews were used to examine voter attitudes and preferences during the campaign, April 27-29, 2015; election day itself occurred on May 5, 2015. Respondents provide information regarding government and party leader preferences, voting intentions, and election predictions. Respondents were also queried on issues that had an impact on their vote and which the new government should address, the effectiveness of Jim Prentice as Premier of Alberta, and whether a majority or minority government would best serve the interests of Alberta. This study has a sample of 761 respondents: 460 through the online survey tool and 301 by telephone.
