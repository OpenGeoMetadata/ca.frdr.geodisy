Prior to this study, the Manitoba Gambling Control Commission (MGCC) conducted the <em>2013 Liquor and Gambling in Manitoba Study<\/em>. The MGCC was also responsible for the previous version of the Liquor and Gambling study, the <em>Manitobans and Gambling<\/em> series, which began in 2004 and was conducted in three-year cycles (2004, 2007, 2010). The study has two sections. The first explores prevalence rates of alcohol consumption and gambling participation in the province. In the second section, the study gathers data with respect to:<ul> \r\n<li>Gambling participation by gambling type;<\/li>\r\n<li>Motivations for gambling;<\/li>\r\n<li>Definitions of responsible gambling;<\/li>\r\n<li>Gambling limit-setting strategies;<\/li>\r\n<li>Awareness of responsible gambling tools and resources; and<\/li>\r\n<li>The prevalence of gambling-related harm and problem gambling in the province<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Sampling was stratified to ensure the inclusion of participants from the four major regions of the province (Winnipeg, Brandon, Southern Manitoba, and Northern Manitoba). Where the random sample diverged from population data, weights based on the 2011 Canadian Census corrected for minor discrepancies in gender, age, and household income. In total, 1,200 adult residents of Manitoba (age 18+) completed the Liquor and Gambling survey (Winnipeg: <em>n=<\/em> 622; Brandon: <em>n=<\/em>143; Southern Manitoba: <em>n=<\/em>301; and Northern Manitoba: <em>n=<\/em>134).<\/p>\r\n<p>The questionnaire for the <em>2016 Liquor and Gambling of Manitoba Study<\/em> is based upon the questionnaires developed for the 2013 study and the <em>Manitobans and Gambling<\/em> series. The components of the questionnaire are also adapted from the Gambling Motives Questionnaire \u2013 Financial (GMQ-F), and the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI). The intended use of the study is to inform the LGA\u2019s responsible drinking and responsible gambling initiatives.<\/p>\r\n ","dct_issued_dt":"2018-07-09T00:00:00Z","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://doi.org/10.5683/SP/2ZARY2\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"http://geoserver.frdr.ca/geodisy/10/5683/SP/2ZARY2/iso19115.zip\"}","dc_creator_sm":["Liquor and Gaming Authority of Manitoba"],"geoblacklight_version":"1.0","layer_id_s":"g_10_5683_sp_2zary2m2","dct_isPartOf_sm":"Liquor and Gambling in Manitoba 2016 [Canada] "}
