Engelmann spruce seeds were grown in a greenhouse and growth chamber in soils collected from four study areas in the Canadian Rocky Mountains to determine if soils collected beyond treeline constrained or enhanced seedling growth and survival. Various properties of the soil were analyzed to identify possible causes for the observed soil effects.
