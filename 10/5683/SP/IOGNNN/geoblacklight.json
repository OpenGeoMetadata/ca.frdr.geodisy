Some questions within the 2003 study were asked only to respondents in the 16-30 age range due to the difficult nature of the subject. Accompanying this dataset are questionnaire documentation including draft questions from stakeholder government departments, summary (topline) and comprehensive statistics from the data, as well as final reports and presentations.
