Turfgrasses were inoculated with M. nivale and assessed visually on a scale of 0-100 percent yellowed, when under various simulations of predicted climate change conditions. Data collected during this investigation includes amino acid concentrations, field trial data, and sugar content data. This dataset includes only the field trial data. Please see Related Datasets for links to the amino acid concentrations and sugar content datasets.
