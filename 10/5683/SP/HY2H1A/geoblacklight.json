The study examines youth expectations of government and what roles they feel it could or should play. Key themes in the 2007 study include: Issues affecting youth and Canada as well as how government should prioritize its actions, Canadian identify and political engagement, the economy and labour market, official languages, health, and media consumption. The 2007 study includes 2 datasets: a sample of 2,015 Canadians who participated in a telephone survey, and a sample of 2,418 Canadians who participated online.  In both cases, respondents are aged 12-30 and both samples are representative of Canada\u2019s age and gender composition in accordance with 2006 census data.  Several questions in this study have been tracked from previous Reconnecting Government with Youth Studies and are referenced as such in the accompanying reports.  Accompanying this study are questionnaire documentation including draft questions, aggregate statistics from the data, as well as final reports and presentations.
