The 2005 study examines issues affecting youth at the time as well as government responses, volunteering, post-secondary education and plans after high school, how government can communicate with youth as well as cigarette and marijuana use. The 2005 study's dataset consists of a sample of 2001 Canadians from across the country, aged 12-30, who participated through a nationwide telephone survey between May 18 and June 13, 2005. A subsequent online survey was held between June 10-14. Results from the online survey appear in some reports but are not included in the telephone raw dataset.  Both datasets and their results are representative of the nation's regional, age, and gender composition for 12 to 30 year-olds in accordance with Census 2001 data. Some questions in the study are asked only to older age segments (e.g., 16-30 year age groups) due to the more difficult nature of relevance of some questions. This study consists of numeric data, aggregate statistical tables, stakeholder reports and presentations, as well as its questionnaire and its many drafts.
