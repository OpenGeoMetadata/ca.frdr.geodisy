This study investigates the mechanisms contributing to permafrost thaw on ice-cored peat plateaux in subarctic Canada. To answer this question, freeze and thaw depths for four years (2011, 2015-2017) are presented, as well as micrometereological data recorded at half hour intervals on a Campbell Scientific CR10X data logger. Details of instruments and installation heights are included in the aforementioned manuscript.
