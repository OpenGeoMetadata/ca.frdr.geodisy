The goal of the study is to characterize the relationships between plant-available nitrogen and productivity and to see how these relationships are manifested in hyperspectral signatures. These data files contain soil nitrogen availability, carbon dioxide exchange, and environmental measurements of a High Arctic wetland across the growing season.  Soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations were measured by ion exchange resin membranes and analyzed using automated flow colourimetry. Net ecosystem exchange and ecosystem respiration were measured using closed, static chambers according to methods in Beamish et al. (2014). Environmental measurements (soil moisture, soil temperature, and active layer depth) were taken twice weekly at site adjacent to the locations of the ion exchange resins.
