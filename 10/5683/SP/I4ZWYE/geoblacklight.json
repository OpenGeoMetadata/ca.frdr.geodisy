An online survey tool was used to examine voter attitudes and preferences in the 41st Ontario general election.  Respondents were polled in five waves: Wave 1, May 6-9 (n=821); Wave 2, May 12-14 (n=801); Wave 3, May 20-21 (n=800); Wave 4, May 26-29 (n=868); Wave 5, June 3 (post-debate) - June 6 (n=2,140).
