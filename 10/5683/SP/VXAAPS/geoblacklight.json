This probe collects hourly data on soil moisture and soil temperature at 5cm, 20cm and 50cm into the ground. Precipitation levels are also collected from the probe. This set includes soil moisture data collected from 2013 to 2016. This data is important to researchers who want to achieve the lowest possible soil moisture measurement error. The results are important of the calibration and validation of satellite missions and model parameterization.
