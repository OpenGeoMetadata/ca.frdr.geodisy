# Geodisy GeoBlacklight Metadata Repository

This repository is the most current geospatial metadata harvested into the FRDR map-based search platform [Geodisy](geo.frdr.ca). We are happy to have any institution index our metadata.

#### Metadata validation

Our metadata is valididated to be compliant with the validated to be in compliance with the current [GeoBlacklight 1.0 schema](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/blob/master/schema/geoblacklight-schema.md), however, we use the parent-child record relationship slightly differently. We use that relationship to show a related record or sibling relationship, so this may result in somewhat strange looking record pages if there are related records, but it will not break the record page enough to make it not display.
