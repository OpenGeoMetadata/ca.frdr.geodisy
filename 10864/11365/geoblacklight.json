The aim of Health Statistics at a Glance tables is to present a core data set using the most recent information available. The indicator tables show extended time series for Canada, provinces and territorial levels of geography. Depending on the indicator, cross-cl\r\nassifications are by age and sex, and, in some cases by education. Due to the large amount of sample survey data used to construct the indicators, many tables cannot be produced for sub-provincial areas.\r\n<\/p> <p>Health Statistics at a Glance is an integrated information product. Its content reflects the growing demand for analysis of many current health issues supplemented by the underlying data. Within this CD-ROM there are three major components: the Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, 17 Health Reports articles cited in the Statistical Report, and all of the components of Health Indicators, including Causes of Death. Users access the data as tabulations that they can display in var\r\nious formats according to their own needs. The Health Statistics at a Glance CD-ROM contains the entire database of over 100 indicators and the software to access the information on a personal computer. The database can be accessed on the mainframe computer by using Statistics Canada's CANSIM cross-classified database.\r\n<\/p> ","dct_issued_dt":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://hdl.handle.net/10864/11365\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"http://geoserver.frdr.ca/geodisy/10864/11365/iso19115.zip\"}","dc_creator_sm":["Statistics Canada"],"geoblacklight_version":"1.0","layer_id_s":"g_10864_11365m1"}
