These surveys measure Canadians' views on public policy priorities and their assessment of how the Government of Canada serves Canadians in responding to those priorities.  The surveys were conducted by Communications Canada. The questions ask opinions on Government of Canada priorities, the internet, access to Government information and the ability to access Government services. The respondents were also asked questions so that they could be grouped according to geographic and social variables.
