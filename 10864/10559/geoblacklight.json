It is being supervised by Dr. Altaf Arain, Professor in the School. \r The primary purpose of this weather station is to support undergraduate and graduate teaching and serve the campus and \r surrounding community in west Hamilton. \r The station was established in October 2007 and a number of meteorological\nvariables are being measured. Those using data are \r encouraged to check sensor details. \r \r Note: A large open space free of surrounding obstacles was not available at McMaster University campus to install this weather station. \r General Science Building roof top was the most appropriate location, available.  \r ================================================================\r * Station location:\r \r McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada.\r Latitude: 43°15'\n42.93\" N\r Longitude: 79°  55'  11.86\" W\r Ground elevation: 90 m above sea level\r Roof surface elevation: 114 m above sea level\r \r ================================================================\r * Sensor descriptions and heights:\r \r 1. Wind sensor at 7m above the roof surface\r - Wind speed and wind direction are measured using R.M. Young Wind Monitor, model 05103. The wind speed sensor is a helicoid-shaped, \r four-blade propeller-type, anemometer, with fuselage and tail wind vane.\r (http://ww\nw.campbellsci.com/05103-l)\r \r 2. Radiation sensor at 2m above the roof surface\r - Measured using four-sensor net radiometer, manufactured by the Kipp and Zonen, model CNR1. The radiometer measures the energy \r balance between incoming short-wave (CM3 sensor) and long-wave (CG3 sensor) radiation versus surface reflected shortwave and outgoing longwave radiation. \r The CNR1 also includes a sensor to measure the radiometer's internal temperature and a heater that is used to prevent condensation.\r (\nhttp://www.kippzonen.com/Product/33/CNR-1)\r \r 3. Air temperature and humidity sensors at 2 m above the roof surface\r - Air temperature and relative humidity are measured using Vaisala RH and Temperature Probe, model HMP45C. Probe is covered with a radiation shield. \r The probe uses a capacitive polymer H chip to measure RH and a PRT to measure temperature.\r (http://www.campbellsci.com/hmp45c-l)\r \r 4. Barometer at 1.5 m above the roof surface\r - Atmospheric pressure is measured by R.M. Young Baro\nmetric Pressure Sensor, model 61205.\r \r 5. Rain gauge at 1 m above the roof surface\r - Precipitation is measured by a R.M. Young Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge, model 52202, which meets the specifications of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). \r It is heated for operation in cold temperatures.\r (http://www.campbellsci.ca/52202)\r \r Data File Description:\r - Data are available as comma-separated, ASCII-encoded files, produced separately for each year.  Three files are created for each year, wh\nich reflect the time\r step of measurements:\r 1. 15-minute files (e.g. MCM_WX_Met_Stn_Met2_2010.csv) are time series of variables, calculated by the data logging software as the average (or sum) value\r for all 5-second sample measurements within that period.  The values reported represent the mean for the preceding 15 minutes. \r 2*. Hourly files (e.g. MCM_WX_Met_Stn_Met2_2010_Hourly.csv) are aggregated at hourly time steps from the 15-minute files.\r 3*. Daily files (e.g. MCM_WX_Met_Stn_Met2_2010_\nDaily.csv) are aggregated at daily time steps from the 15-minute files.\n* Note that some variables (e.g. Albedo) are not well-represented by the hourly and daily aggregation. Therefore, it is recommended for the 15-minute files to be \r used as the bases for further analyses\r \r ================================================================\r * Descriptions of Variables\r \r Year\t(EST) \r JulianDay\t(EST) - Day of year (1-365 or 366)\r End_Time\t(HrMn_EST) -ending Hour and Minute of samples used to make average\r Month\t(EST)\r Day\t(EST)\r CM3_DownSW_Avg\t(W/m2)\t - Mean dow\nn-welling shortwave radiation\r CM3_DownSW_Max\t(W/m2)\t - Maximum down-welling shortwave radiation\r CM3_DownSW_Min\t(W/m2)\t - Minimum down-welling shortwave radiation\r CM3_UpSW_Avg\t(W/m2)\t - Mean up-welling shortwave radiation\r CM3_UpSW_Max\t(W/m2)\t - Maximum up-welling shortwave radiation\r CM3_UpSW_Min\t(W/m2)\t - Minimum up-welling shortwave radiation\r CNR1_DownLW_Avg\t(W/m2)\t - Mean down-welling longwave radiation\r CNR1_UpLW_Avg\t(W/m2)\t - Mean up-welling longwave radiation\r CNR1_Temp_Avg\t(degC)\t - M\nean CNR1 correction temperature (not air temperature)\r CNR1_NetRad_SW_Avg\t(W/m2)\t - Mean net shortwave radiation\r CNR1_NetRad_LW_Avg\t(W/m2)\t - Mean net longwave radiation\r Albedo_Avg\t(n/a)\t - Mean  albedo\r CNR1_DownSW_Avg\t(W/m2)\t - Mean down-welling shortwave radiation\r CNR1_UpSW_Avg\t(W/m2)\t - Mean up-welling shortwave radiation\r CNR1_NetRad_Avg\t(W/m2)\t - Mean net radiation\r PanelTemp_Avg\t(degC)\t - Mean datalogger panel temperature (not air temperature)\r HMP45C_AirTemp_Avg\t(degC)\t - Mean  air te\nmperature\r HMP45C_AirTemp_Max\t(degC)\t - Maximum  air temperature\r HMP45C_AirTemp_Min\t(degC)\t - Minimum  air temperature\r WindChill_Avg\t(degC)\t - Mean wind chill temperature\r HMP45C_RelHum_Avg\t(%)\t - Mean  relative humidity\r HMP45C_RelHum_Max\t(%)\t - Maximum  relative humidity\r HMP45C_RelHum_Min\t(%)\t - Minimum  relative humidity\r DewPoint_Avg\t(degC)\t - Mean  Dewpoint temperature\r VapPres_Avg\t(kPa)\t - Mean  vapour pressure\r SatVapPres_Avg\t(kPa)\t - Mean  saturation vapour pressure\r Humidex_Avg\t(degC\n)\t - Mean  humidex\r WindSpd_m/s_Avg\t(m/s)\t - Mean  wind speed\r WindDir_Avg\t(deg)\t - Mean  wind direction\r WindDir_Std_Avg\t(deg)\t - Mean  wind direction\r WindSpd_k/h_Avg\t(k/h)\t - Mean  wind speed\r WindDir2_Avg\t(deg)\t - Mean  wind direction\r WindDir_Std2_Avg\t(deg)\t - Mean  wind direction\r WindSpd_k/h_Max\t(k/h)\t - Maximum  wind speed\r WindDir_WindSpd_Max\t(deg)\t - Wind direction at maximum wind speed  \r WindSpd_k/h_Min\t(k/h)\t - Minimum  wind speed\r WindDir_WindSpd_Min\t(deg)\t - Wind direction at mini\nmum wind speed  \r Pressure_Raw_Avg\t(kPa)\t - Mean  barometric pressure (uncorrected)\r Pressure\t(kPa)\t - Mean  barometric pressure (corrected)\r Pressure_Max\t(kPa)\t - Maximum  barometric pressure\r Pressure_Min\t(kPa)\t - Minimum  barometric pressure\r Precipitation_Sum\t(mm)\t - Summed  precipitation\r CertificationCode\t(n/a)\t -   \r RevisionDate\t(YYYYMMDD)\t - Last date of update ","dct_issued_dt":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://hdl.handle.net/10864/10559\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"http://geoserver.frdr.ca/geodisy/10864/10559/iso19115.zip\"}","dc_creator_sm":["Jason Brodeur"],"geoblacklight_version":"1.0","layer_id_s":"g_10864_10559m1"}
