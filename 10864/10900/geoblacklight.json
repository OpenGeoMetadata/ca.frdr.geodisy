This station collects hourly climatic data including air temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and speed, solar radiation, net radiation, precipitation, and soil temperature. This data set includes climatic data collected from 2008 to 2012. For 2008 to Julian Day 60, 2010, Array 160 was utilized to collect climatic data. This data is presented as annual data files broken down into three categories: daily diagnostic data, hourly data, and precipitation data (every minute of occurrence). Starting on\r\nJulian Day 195, 2010, Array 11 was utilized to collect climatic data.  There is no snowfall, soil temperature or radiation data available for Array 11. The variables (and units of measure) are also different for data collected from Julian Day 195, 2010 to 2012 than those collected for 2008 to Julian Day 60, 2010. The data is presented as annual data files broken down into two categories: hourly data and precipitation data (every minute of occurrence).
