As part of this program, registration and performance tests are conducted annually at various locations across the main bean growing areas in Ontario. This study provides the results of the 2011 and 2012 White Bean Registration and Performance Trials where several varieties of white beans were evaluated in multi-location yield-trials across Ontario.   In 2011, white bean entries were planted in four replicated test plots at six locations across Ontario; Brussels, Elora, Highbury,  Kippen, St. Thomas, and Woodstock. In 2012, white bean entries were planted in four replicated test plots at six locations across Ontario; Blyth, Elora, Highbury, Kippen, St. Thomas, and Woodstock. Agronomic data including yield (adjusted to 18% moisture after combine harvest), days to maturity (number of days from planting to maturity), seed weight (estimated for 100 seeds), and seed quality were collected for each plot in each location.  Disease resistance data including common bacterial blight, anthracnose, root rot, and white mould is also included.
