Since subconstituencies tend to remain relatively stable from election to election, the subconstituency was selected as the basic unit of analysis. Each record consists of election returns data and census figures describing the ethnic and religious background of the subconstituency population.  Election results were correlated with figures drawn from the next decennial census. Reports of the Chief Electoral Officer (for each election in the Parliamentary Sessional Papers), served as the source of the returns data. Following Dr. Kerr's sudden death in 1976, the data were deposited in the Social Science Computing Laboratory (SSCL) for use by other researchers.  The data have been cleaned, documented and otherwise prepared for dissemination by SSCL (now Social Sciences Technology S\nervices).
