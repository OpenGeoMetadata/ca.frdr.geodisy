Until now, we have not been able to show any protective effects of n-3 fatty acids on the reduction of arterial thickness. Finally marine lipids seem to be a good protector against mental disorders especially psychological distress. Inuit hunters and other experts identify a variety of observable changes in fat composition and amount in key Arctic country food species. These changes have been taking place for some time, however, represent a trend in long term changes in body condition of Arctic species potentially related to environmental change, Inuit report varying knowledge of contemporary and traditional sources of fat in their diet. Perspectives on fats appear to be considered in diet decisions but the strength of this influence has not yet been determined. Contrary to anecdotal information, no residents appear to be applying dietary fat reduction actions towards their consumption of country foods. The general objective of the URQSUK program is to better understand the importance of fat and lipids in the Arctic such as the presence, distribution, changes and associated factors as well as their health effects. Projects 1-3 are linked to the International Cohort Study run by PIs E Dewailly (Laval U), K Young (U of Toronto), G Egeland (McGill U), P Bjerregaard (Danish Institute of Public Health), B Boyer (Alaska) and also the CIHR Team Grant run by Dr Kue Young (U of Toronto). The Urqsuk Program is also linked to the Nasivvik Centre for Inuit Health and Changing Environments as researchers have accessed complementary funding\nto provide training and capacity building to Inuit. The first 3 projects through the analysis of data collected during the 2004 Qanuippitaa Nunavik Health Survey and the 2007-2008 Qanuippitali Inuit Health Survey aim to investigate the role of n-fatty acids on Inuit health.
