It probes people in regards to their feelings towards the federation and whether they understand tensions that rule the country. After better understanding feelings of exclusion, surveyors questioned respondents on the level of respect their province receives federally, in regards to changes brought to the democratic institutions which could make them feel more included and on the effects of the equalization program. The survey was administered to 2412 Canadians. The provinces included in this survey are BC, Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan.
