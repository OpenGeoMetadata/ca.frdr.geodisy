The results are the prime source of road vehicle use information for researchers and interested members of the public.  Prior to 2004, the survey was sponsored by Transport Canada. Since then, the survey has been co-sponsored by Transport Canada and Natural Resources Canada. They plan to combine the survey data with other data to improve road safety, monitor fuel consumption and deal with the impact of vehicle usage on the environment.
