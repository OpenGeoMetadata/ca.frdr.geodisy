The study was designed to capture the expenses and income of students on a monthly basis, in order to profile the financial circumstances of Canadian post-secondary students and the adequacy of available funding. The Web-based Students Financial Survey provided accurate, quantifiable results for the first ti\nme on such issues as the incidence and level of assistance, the level of debt from outstanding bank loans, personal lines of credit, and credit cards. The study also yielded up-to-date information on student assets (such as automobiles, computers, and electronics), student earnings, time usage, and types of expenses incurred. The survey featured a panel of 1,524 post-secondary students from across the country, who participated in a very brief monthly survey, either via Internet or telephone. Students were required to complete a longer baseline wave of the survey in order to participate in the study. The baseline survey asked a number of questions concerning summer income and existing debt, including credit card debt.\n<\/p> <p>This dataset was received from the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation as is.
