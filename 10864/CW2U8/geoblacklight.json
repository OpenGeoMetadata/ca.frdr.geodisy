The 3 year (Winter of 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013) field experiment involved three warming levels: heated ~4 degrees Celsius above ambient, unheated with snow cover left intact, and unheated with snow cover removed. Survival and date of emergence were examined in all years, and beetle lipid content was analyzed in one year to determine rates of energy use. The laboratory experiment assessed effects of frequency and duration of fluctuating thermal regimes on survival.
