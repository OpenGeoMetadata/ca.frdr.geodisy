Patients undergoing haemodialysis are at a greater risk of acquiring HBV infection. Although HBV vaccination has been in use for almost three decades, it is not completely certain about its efficacy in long-term protection. Few studies in the past have emphasized the need for evaluation of anti-HBsAg antibody titers among high risk groups that include patients undergoing haemodialysis. Studies in the past have also noted that few vaccinated group do not respond to HBV vaccine and that few other group of vaccinated individuals develop inadequate antibody titers. The present study evaluated the antibody titers among haemodialysis patients and health care workers.
