Data for the territories are available for 1998, 1999 and every second year thereafter.<\/p><p>The 2011 SHS was conducted from January 2011 to December 2011 using a sample of 17,873 households in the 10 provinces (the territories were not includ\r\ned in the 2011 survey). Detailed spending information was collected, as well as limited information on dwelling characteristics and household equipment. The method of adjusting for incomplete diaries has been refined with the 2011 SHS. As well, the age of household members is now defined to be at the time of the interview rather than as of December 31st of the survey year. To ensure comparability of the data, the 2010 data have also been revised by incorporating these changes. The revised 2010 estimate of average household spending on all types of goods and services has increased by 1.3% when compared with the previously published 2010 estimate (April 2012).\r\n<\/p><p>Starting with the 2011 SHS, Standard Tables are available in CANSIM.
