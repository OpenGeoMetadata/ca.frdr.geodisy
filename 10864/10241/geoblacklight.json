Wastewater and water treatment methods are a particular challenge for northern communities. Disparities in access to safe water treatment methods have been shown between southern/urban populations and northern/Inuit/remote communities. Current wastewater treatment systems are rudimentary in the north because of constraints caused by remoteness, climate, and socio-economic factors. Constructed wetland systems for wastewater treatment are an example of a sustainable, environmentally sound technology available for use in polar regions. This project is developing new engineering and technology solutions to assist Northern communities to adapt to changing demographic patterns and associated public sanitation and related health issues. The current disparity in safe, economical, and effective wastewater treatment is due to a number of factors including logistical issues such as construction and operational limitations, and limited capacity within communities including the requirements for skilled labour. Constructed wetlands present a viable alternative option to some of these problems. Researchers at the Centre for Alternative Wastewater Treatment, Fleming College, are studying the performance, efficacy and functioning of existing natural wetland treatment systems in six communities in Nunavut and examining the chemical and microbial processes occurring in treatment wetlands in cold climates. We are also collaborating with the United Nations Environment Programme to create software that can model treatment wetlands in cold climates and serve as a design and educational tool in the Canadian Arctic and other cold climate regions throughout the world. This project also includ\nes a significant training component through the hiring and training of northern community research assistants to conduct sampling, assist with lab analysis and monitor the pilot wetland cells. It will also contribute to capacity building through targeted community oriented workshops and training of highly qualified personnel.
