Meteorological data collection began at the Guelph Turfgrass Institute in September 1993. This station collects hourly climatic data including air temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and speed, solar radiation, net radiation, precipitation, and soil temperature. This data set includes climatic data collected from 1993 to 1997, and is presented as monthly data files broken down into six categories: hourly data, 0800 data (maximum/minimum values for data collected from 1600 yesterday to 0800 today), 1600 data (maximum/minimum values for data collected from 0800 today to 1600 tod\r\nay), at 2400 hours (maximum/minimum values for data collected from 0800 today to 1600 today), precipitation data (every minute of occurrence), and short circuit data (number of times the short circuit voltage is above a set level of 0.100 volts). Supplement data is also available; the weather station supplement data were collected by hand.
