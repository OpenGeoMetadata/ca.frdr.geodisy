This station collects hourly climatic data including air temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and speed, solar radiation, net radiation, precipitation, and soil temperature. This data set includes climatic data collected from 2003 to 2007. The 2003 to 2005 data is presented as annual data files broken down into six categories: hourly data, 0800 data (maximum/minimum values for data collected from 1600 yesterday to 0800 today), 1600 data (maximum/minimum values for data collected from 0800\r\ntoday to 1600 today), at 2400 hours (maximum/minimum values for data collected at hour 2400), precipitation (every minute of occurrence), and short circuit data (number of times the short circuit voltage is above a set level of 0.100 Volts). Starting in 2006, a different set of variables were collected. The 2006 and 2007 data is presented as annual files broken down into three categories: daily diagnostic data, hourly data, and precipitation data. Supplement data is also available; the weather station supplement data were collected by hand.
