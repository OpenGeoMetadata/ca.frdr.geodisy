Seeds were broadcast seeded into 2 x 2-m plots in a tilled, old-field grassland community in a completely randomised block experimental design.  Schedonorus abundance, endophyte infection rate, and the co-occurring vegetation were sampled 3, 4, 5, and 6 yr after establishment, and the aboveground invertebrate community was sampled in S. pratensis plots 3 and 4 yr after establishment.
