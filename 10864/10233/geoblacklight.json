At the consultations, the Inuit requested that we undertake our telemetry studies in James Bay, an area where there are a large number of animals, but also where we know very little about their stock relationships with Hudson Bay beluga, their movement and diving behaviour and overwintering areas. Furthermore, James Bay is also responsible for approximately 70% of the total freshwater inflow into the Hudson Bay region, so changes in physical environmental conditions in this area will have wide reaching impacts on Hudson Bay and freshwater inflow into the Northwest Atlantic.
