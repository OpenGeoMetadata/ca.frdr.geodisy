Colleges wanted further insight into their applicant pool to optimize the use of scarce resources, time, and money. In addition, it provided information for marketing, recruitment, and enrolment management strategies. It also covered applicants' financial preparedness for college. Par\nticipants were selected from a random sample that matched key demographic indicators (e.g. age, region, and applicant status) ensuring representation of the general applicant pool. Some of the\nmajor subject areas covered include prior education, college selection, issues of concern, academic activities, and finances.\n<\/p> <p> This dataset was freely received from the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation. Some work was required for the variable and value labels, and missing values. They were corrected as best as possible with the documentation received.
