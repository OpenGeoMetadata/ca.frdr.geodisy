Citizens were also queried regarding their attitude towards the obligations/roles of common institutions in protecting privacy including employers and governments, commercial organizations, police and intelligence agencies, and airport security. The study was conducted on behalf of the international scholarly research group based out of the Surveillance Studies Centre at Queen's University (http://www.sscqueens.org/). It re-asked many of the same categories of questions as the earlier Globalization of Personal Data (GPD) Project, allowing for a comparator of awareness of and attitudes towards surveillance and privacy between 2005 and 2012.\r\n<\/p> ","dct_issued_dt":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://hdl.handle.net/10864/10558\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"http://geoserver.frdr.ca/geodisy/10864/10558/iso19115.zip\"}","dc_creator_sm":["Angus Reid Global"],"geoblacklight_version":"1.0","layer_id_s":"g_10864_10558m1","dct_isPartOf_sm":"Privacy and Surveillance: June 2012 Globalization of Personal Data Follow-up"}
