The primary objective of the survey was to track the expenses and income of students on a monthly basis, in order to profile the financial circumstances of Canadian students and the adequacy of available funding. The survey will allow the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation to understand the financial circumstances of students who are in a post-\nsecondary environment on an annual basis. <\/p>  <p>This research is a joint effort of the Foundation, all participating colleges and the Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC). The survey collects data on college students' income, expenditures and use of time. The survey is unique in that it provides national-level information on the challenges Canadian college students face in terms of financial and access issues. The objectives of the research are to: provide national-level data on\nstudent access; time use and financing for Canadian college students from participating colleges; identify issues particular to certain learner groups and/or regions; and provide each institution with top-line survey results (based on representative samples of their students); which may then be compared against the \"national average\". In January 2003, the Foundation engaged Prairie Research Associates (PRA) Inc. to oversee this research.\n<\/p> <p> This dataset was freely received from the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation.
