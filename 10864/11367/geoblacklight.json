This survey provides a comprehensive measure of ICT infrastructure and access, and identifies access patterns in elementary and secondary schools across Canada. Statistics Canada, in partnership with Industry Canadas SchoolNet program (the survey sponsor), conducted ICTSS in October 2003. SchoolNet works with Canadian learning partners -- provincial and territorial governments, education associations, school boards, schools, teachers and students -- to increase access to and integration of ICT into the learning environment. The goal is to develop an ICT-skilled population, capable of participating in todays economy (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat 2002). Support to the survey initiative has also been provided by Library and Archives Canada.
