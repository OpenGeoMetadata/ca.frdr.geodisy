IT employers and employees were surveyed separately, but simultaneously. The employer survey consisted of questions on occupation profile, hiring and recruitment, employee retention, and training and development. The employee survey had questions on the occupational histo\r\nry of IT employees, salary, education, training, and skills. The target population consisted of private sector locations with at least six employees, and with at least one employee working in IT, as well as public-sector divisions with at least one IT employee.\r\n<\/p>  <p>The NSITO is a three-stage survey. First, a sample of employers in both private and public sectors is selected; this is stage 1. The questions asked in stage 1 are essentially about the IT workforce. Stage 2 involves selecting a maximum of two occupations (out of 25) per employer. The questions asked in this stage deal with hiring, training and retaining employees in the selected occupations. In stage 3, a maximum of 10 employees are sampled for each occupation selected in stage 2. Amon\r\ng the subjects that employees are asked about are training, previous employment and demographic characteristics.\r\n<\/p> ","dct_issued_dt":"2016-12-13T00:00:00Z","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://hdl.handle.net/10864/11374\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"http://geoserver.frdr.ca/geodisy/10864/11374/iso19139.zip\"}","dc_creator_sm":["Statistics Canada"],"geoblacklight_version":"1.0","layer_id_s":"g_10864_11374m1"}
