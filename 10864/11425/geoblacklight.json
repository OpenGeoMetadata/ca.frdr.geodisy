Walking, cycling, public transit, and driving and even rollerblading were acceptable travel modes, and each trip was counted as long as the trip had an origin, a destination, and a purpose. Walking around the block, or other \u2018trips\u2019 considered by respondents solely as exercise, were excluded. Other demographic and household information was also gathered, including age, gender, employment status, and number of vehicles available to the household. A random sample of people over the age of 15 years living in the Greater Kingston Area was gathered -- equivalent to 2.3% of the target population. This resulted in a sample size determined to be representative for statistical purposes.
