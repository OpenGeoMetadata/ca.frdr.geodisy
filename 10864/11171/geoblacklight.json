For 2001, a new farm type classification based on the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) has been added to the historical classification used in previous censuses. All tabulated data are subject to confidentiality restrictions prior to release. Due to confidentiality constraints, data for those geographic areas with very few agricultural operations are not released separately, but rather merged with a geographically adjacent area.
