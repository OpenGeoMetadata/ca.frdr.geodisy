The ASETS replaces the Survey of Approaches to Educational Planning (SAEP), the Post-secondary Education Participation Survey (PEPS) and the Adult Education and Training Survey (AETS), which were last conducted in 2002 and 2003. Bringing together the three surveys realizes economies of scale in the management, development, implementation and dissemination of the survey.
