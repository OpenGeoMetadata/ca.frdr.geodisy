Data for the territories are available for 1998, 1999 and every second year thereafter.<\/p> <p>The main purpose of the survey is to obtain detailed information about household spending during the reference year (previous calendar year). Inform\r\nation is also collected about dwelling characteristics as well as household equipment.\r\n<\/p> <p>The SHS has been redesigned with the aim to better adapt the collection methods and the reference periods to the capacity of the respondent to provide accurate information. Thus, the 2010 survey used a different collection methodology from previous surveys.<\/p> <p>The new methodology combines a questionnaire with recall periods based on the type of expenditure (1, 3 or 12 months, last payment, four weeks) and a daily expenditure diary that the household completes for two weeks following\r\nthe interview. As well, data collection is now continuous throughout the year. This methodology is similar to the one used by most household spending surveys in other countries.\r\n<\/p> ","dct_issued_dt":"2017-01-16T00:00:00Z","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://hdl.handle.net/10864/11273\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"http://geoserver.frdr.ca/geodisy/10864/11273/iso19115.zip\"}","dc_creator_sm":["Statistics Canada"],"geoblacklight_version":"1.0","layer_id_s":"g_10864_11273m1"}
