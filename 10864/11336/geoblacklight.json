The data are drawn from two household surveys: the Survey of Consumer Finances(SCF) and the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID). Historical data prior to 1996 are drawn from the SCF and data since 1996 are taken from SLID. In addition to provincial detail, many of the tables present estimates for the 15 largest Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs), as follows: Halifax, Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa-Hull, Toronto, St.-Catharines- Niagara, Hamilton-Burlington, Kitchener-Waterloo, London, Windsor, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Victoria. Due to the sample size limitations and sampling variability, estimates for urban areas are less reliable and are subject to larger errors than provincial and national estimates. Given the variability of the annual estimates, users are cautioned against drawing conclusions from single year-to-year comparisons alone.
