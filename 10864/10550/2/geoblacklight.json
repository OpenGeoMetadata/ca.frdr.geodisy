Mean depth = 12.6; maximum depth = 30.1 m; surface area = 15.0 ha, shoreline = 1762.2 m. Round Lake receives inflow from a series of wetlands and small creeks at its north end. The lake drains south via Garter Lake, to which it is connected through a shallow wetland. From Garter Lake, water eventually reaches the Rideau Canal via Stonehouse and Rock Lake Creeks.
