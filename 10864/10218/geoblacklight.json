Through the support of the International Polar Year (IPY), much of the CARMA Network monitoring activity has been focussed on health and body condition, population trends, and habitat changes of caribou in selected herds across the Arctic. An assessment of body condition provides measurable indicators for ecological monitoring, especially when monitored concurrently with assessments of parasites, disease, habitat quality, distribution, and demographic parameters. Fat and protein levels of cow caribou are considered a good integrator of seasonal environmental conditions (including infectious and parasitic disease) that relate closely to pregnancy success and calf survival. The CARMA Network has developed monitoring protocol manuals to ensure consistency in methods used to measure health and body condition and in data management. CARMA developed an extensive climate database that covers all calving, summer, fall, winter and spring ranges for CARMAÂ¿s herds: Ahiak, Akia-Maniitsoq, Baffin Island, Bathurst, Beverly, Bluenose East, Bluenose West, Cape Bathurst, Central Arctic, Chokotka (Chukotka), George River, Hardangervidda, Iceland, Kangerlussuaq-Sisimiut, Leaf River, Lena, Porcupine, Qamanirjuaq, Southam\npton Island, Sundrun, Taimyr, Teshekpuk Lake, Western Arctic, and Yana Indigirka (Indigurka). As part of synthesis efforts, we are summarizing trends in caribou-relevant climate variables. Climate trends will be identified and related to global climate oscillations, and relevance to caribou ecology will be highlighted.
