The Capital Regional District is an administrative district that encompasses the southern Gulf Islands and the southern tip of Vancouver Island. The survey is a joint initiative of the Canadian Index of Wellbeing in partnership with Victoria Community Foundation and the Capital Regional District. These data represent the Community Wellbeing Survey of the Victoria Capital Region (N=2,236), which includes four core geographic areas: Core (Esquimalt, Oak Bay, Saanich, Victoria, View Royal), Peninsula (Central Saanich, North Saanich, Sidney), West Shore (Colwood, Highlands, Langford, Metochosin, Sooke), and the Gulf Islands (Salt Spring Island, Southern Gulf Island).   The primary objectives of this survey are to (a) gather data on the wellbeing of residents that could be monitored over time; and, (b) to provide information on specific aspects of wellbeing that could be used to inform policy issues and community action. The purpose of the survey is to better understand subjective perceptions of wellbeing of residents in the survey area. The survey provides information based on eight domains of wellbeing, as identified by the Canadian Index of Wellbeing: Community Vitality, Democratic Engagement, Environment, Education, Healthy Populations, Leisure and Culture, Living Standards, and Time Use.   The questionnaire collected additional information about numerous socio-economic and household characteristics.
