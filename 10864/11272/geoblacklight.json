Many data from these two surveys are comparable to the Survey of Household Spending d\r\nata. However, some differences related to methodology, to data quality and to definitions must be considered before comparing these data. Detailed information was collected about expenditures for consumer goods and services, changes in assets, mortgages and other loans, and annual income. Information was also collected about dwelling characteristics (e.g., type and age of heating equipment) and household equipment (e.g., appliances, communications equipment, and vehicles).\r\n<\/p> ","dct_issued_dt":"2017-01-16T00:00:00Z","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://hdl.handle.net/10864/11272\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"http://geoserver.frdr.ca/geodisy/10864/11272/iso19115.zip\"}","dc_creator_sm":["Statistics Canada"],"geoblacklight_version":"1.0","layer_id_s":"g_10864_11272m1"}
