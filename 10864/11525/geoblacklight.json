Rather than providing these publications to libraries under the Depository Services Program (DSP), governments are increasingly 'publishing' exclusively on the web.  In an effort to investigate how Canadian academic depository libraries are handling this trend a survey was developed  and distributed on the InfoDep  Listserv. The survey was sent out 24 April 2001. The last survey response was received 13 May 2001.
