Here we show the result of merging two different topographic datasets derived from two separate airborne magnetic surveys with varying control and sample density. The topographic data were then examined using slope analysis and differential gridding algorithms for lineament and contact edge mapping extraction. The contacts derived were subsequently used to derive a three-dimensional (3D) geological model of the area of study. The final model agrees with previous geological maps of the area and shows the potential of the utilization of topographic data for rapid production of a predictive geological map that could be tested by a number of preselected field verification points.
