Each image is a digital representation of the rock face and is composed of millions of 3D points. An individual data point is composed of a measurement along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes.<\/p> <p>This data set was acquired as part of a PhD thesis entitled, Three-Dimensional Laser Imaging for Rock Mass Characterization. The image data was acquired in 3 field trials over the course of the thesis. Specif\r\nically, the image data is from (1) a road cut at Ivy Lea, Ontario, (2) an underground mine in Sudbury, Ontario, and (3) an underground mine in Thompson, Manitoba.\r\n<\/p> <p>Each image contains information that can be used for rock mass characterization. In the PhD thesis, the images were analyzed to (1) measure joint orientation and (2) surface roughness from 3D data. A third objective was to (3) remove the obstructive wire mesh from 3D data.<\/p> ","dct_issued_dt":"2015-01-26T00:00:00Z","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://hdl.handle.net/10864/10860\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"http://geoserver.frdr.ca/geodisy/10864/10860/iso19115.zip\"}","dc_creator_sm":["Mah, Jason","Samson, Claire","McKinnon, Steve"],"geoblacklight_version":"1.0","layer_id_s":"g_10864_10860m1"}
